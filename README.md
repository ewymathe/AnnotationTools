AnnotationTools
===============

Some useful scripts that deal with annotation: all are written in perl so type ./ScriptName.pl to get usage.

GetExonIntronJunctions.pl: given a gtf file as input, intron/exon and exon/intron junctions are output.

GetNumberExonsPerGene.pl: given a gtf file, the number of exons per gene are output.

Most5TSS.pl: given a gtf file, the coordinates of the most 5' TSS are output.
